            The story of Gotham Bar and Grill is one of seeming contradictions that-to the delight of discerning diners-make surprisingly perfect sense: sophisticated cuisine with mass appeal; knowledgeable service that's never stuffy or pretentious, and a persistent creativity, energy and popularity that make Gotham feel like each season's hottest opening, even though it has been at the forefront of New York's dining scene for over a quarter of a century.The cornerstone of any restaurant is the food and Chef Alfred Portale's cuisine has lured diners to Gotham for twenty-six years. One of the driving forces behind modern American cuisine, Portale helped revolutionize the way Americans dined in the 1980s-breaking with French conventions, calling on previously unfamiliar ingredients from around the world, and exhibiting a fierce devotion to seasonality-and to this day consistently drives himself to create new, of-the-moment dishes that keep the Gotham experience fresh and exciting year after year.
